Welcome to Illicit Finance for investigators, a collection of investigations on illicit financial flows and the business networks behind war and war crimes.

I began mapping illicit financial flows when I set up [Know Your Sanctions](https://knowyoursanctions.com/) and in light of the war in Ukraine, I joined OSINT for Ukraine and decided to write "Illicit Finance" as a way of collating investigations and policy reviews. 

My goals are:

- Identify the networks and illicit funds behind war crimes
- Shed light on policy discussions surrounding sanctions and anti-money laundering with the goal of making recommendations.
- Publish investigations and findings
- Share methods and techniques
