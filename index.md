Welcome to Illicit Finance for investigators, a collection of investigations on illicit financial flows and the business networks behind war and war crimes.

My background is in anti-money laundering solutions and evidence-based policy research. I was first motivated by the challenge of building a global database of sanctioned entities and their networks, so I set up [Know Your Sanctions])(https:/knowyoursanctions.com). In light of Russia's resource grab in Ukraine, I joined OSINT for Ukraine. 

I decided to write “Illicit funds and war” as a way to collate investigations and share them with a broad audience of readers. My goals are:

- Identify the networks and illicit funds behind war crimes
- Shed light on policy discussions surrounding sanctions and anti-money laundering with the goal of making recommendations.
- Publish investigations and findings
- Share methods and techniques
