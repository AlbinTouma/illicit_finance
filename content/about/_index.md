## About the Author


Some about myself, Albin Touma. 

My background is in research and data analysis. As an International Affairs Research Analyst at Comply Advantage, I help build the screening platforms that compliance officers use. 

What motivated me to start Illicit Finance was the challenge of collecting data and exposing networks. 

I first experienced the complexity of illicit finance when building a global database of sanctioned entites and politically exposed persons, [Know Your Sanctions](https://knowyoursanctions.com).  This side project quickly grew into different research projects on how illicit funds are used, but I withheld from publishing. 

In light of Russia's resource grab in Ukraine, I joined [OSINT for Ukraine](https://www.osintforukraine.com/) as an investigator documenting war crimes with a focus on illicit funds. 

After working on tools to support investigations in Ukraine, I decided it was time to publish findings in "Illicit Finance" as a way to collate investigations and share them with a broad audience of readers.
