Domestic public resources are central to financing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Addis Adaba Action Agenda emphasises combating illicit financial flows (IFF) to safeguard these public resources.

Despite substantial work from the United Nations, the World Bank, the IMF, OECD, and civil society, countries have been unable to reach a political consensus on the term "illicit". This lack fo an agreement makes developing methodologies for monitoring and assessing illicit financial flows difficult, and where methodologies exist, disagreements and dissatisfaction with methods stem from the lack of conceptual clarity.  



The IMF defines "illicit" in terms of "illegal" in its definition of illicit financial flows: 

> "Illicit financial flows refer to the movement of money across borders that is illegal in its source, transfer, or use." ~ [IMF Website](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2023/Fight-against-illicit-financial-flows)
