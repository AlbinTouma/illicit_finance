We often talk about sanctions in the context of efficiency or individual cases. Who's who in the sanctions space has, as a result, become elusive when there are characteristics, data sets, and methods of revealing sanctioned entities and members of their networks. 


## Ontology

A big part of researching who's who in the sancioned space is knowing how to describe entities and relations beetween them. In industry, we describe our domain and its objects in an [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology). 

An ontology is a formal naming and definition of categories, properties, and relations betweeen concepts, data, or entities.

One of the most common tasks for an investigative reporter is to work out if one thing is the same as another. Is the person who owns a sanctioned company the same guy who is a mayor in my city?

Many facts might provide hints that allow us to establish if he is "our guy". Do the individuals have the same name, date of birth, nationality, passport number? Do we know about links to other individuals or companies in both data sets? 

When you have a clearly defined ontology, you can turn representations of objects and events into complex data and compile and cross-reference these hints.

### Follow the Money

One common ontology used in anti-corruption investigations is the Follow the Money Ontology. It defines entities relevant in such investigations, like people or companies, and lets you reference entities creating a graph of relationships. 

The Follow the Money ontology consists of schemata ie object types that exist as an inheritance hieracy, rooted in things and events.

**Things** describe real-world objects like ``people``, ``Companies``, ``Assets``, ``Court Cases``. You can think of things as entities. 

**Intervals** are business interests, court cases, sanctions, and transactions and are useful for linking entities together, possibly over time.

### Entity resolution

### Enrichment

### Network Analysis

## OFAC 50

It is relatively straightforward to find out if an individual, vessel, or organisation is subject to financial sanctions. You usually return a match after a quick search of the entity's name or alias on consolidated sanctions lists such as [the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementations](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-consolidated-list-of-targets). 

Identifying if an entity is sanctioned becomes harder when shell companies are involved. A company may not show up as sanctioned, but it is 51% owned by another company which is sanctioned. This means both companies are sanctioned.
