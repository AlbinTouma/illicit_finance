      <title>What is the evidence for public ownership registries?</title>

        &lt;p&gt;While in New York, I asked a friend about his business in Florida and he explained to me that he is the owner through his Scandinavian business. Tracing his ownership structure would be time consuming and the task is made harder by the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to annul public access to ownership registries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CJEU ruled that public access contravenes the right to privacy in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Implicit is the claim that evidence is weak to show that public ownership registries prevents crime. Or, as my friend put it, the argument for public ownership data is a rehash of: &lt;it&gt;if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear&amp;quot;&lt;/it&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the court considers &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; evidence is unclear, so let&amp;rsquo;s start with the strongest case for public access to ownership registries, namely the practice of fighting illicit finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Panama Papers&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;panama-papers&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#panama-papers&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Panama Papers&lt;/a&gt; is the most public exposure of the world&amp;rsquo;s most powerful people and their financial secrets and the impact that those leaks have had serves as an excellent example of the positive impact that public ownership data has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 11.5 million records exposed how politicians and criminals use the rogue offshore finance industry to launder money and avoid taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaks implicated &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_named_in_the_Panama_Papers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;150 politicians from 50 countries&lt;/a&gt; and had serious political fallout as Iceland&amp;rsquo;s Prime Minister, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/iceland-prime-minister-resigns-over-panama-papers-revelations&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sigmundur Davio Gunnlaugsson&lt;/a&gt;, was forced to resign from his office amid outrage that his family had sheltered money offshore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the revelations that caused snap elections in Iceland, the Guardian used the offshore leaks to shed light on the trail between Vladimir Putin and an offshore network of assets &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/panama-papers-money-hidden-offshore&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;worth $2bn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panama Papers show that transparent ownership is vital to fighting corruption and that when ownership structures are made public, those implicit in illicit finance face legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigative journalists and their hard work not only helped close Mossack Fonseca, the infamous Panamanian law firm and target of the leak, but has also led to the prosecution of the firm&amp;rsquo;s owners, Lauria Paz and Ramon Fonseca who are defendants in a case in Panama where they are being tried for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.organojudicial.gob.pa/noticias/fijan-nueva-fecha-de-audiencia-para-celebrar-juicio-en-caso-conocido-como-panama-papers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;crimes against public economic order&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Lauria Pax and Ramon Fronseca operated Mossack Fronseca and how their crimes impacted ordinary people inspired &amp;ldquo;The Laundromat&amp;rdquo;, a film starring Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;

&lt;iframe class=&#39;iframe&#39; margin-top=10 width=&#34;600&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wuBRcfe4bSo?si=5R4jvk5i5q7k0q72&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film sheds light on some of the consequences of illicit financial crime and the reality that those criminals are able to hide in jurisdictions where ownership can remain opaque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Open Lux Investigation&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-open-lux-investigation&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-open-lux-investigation&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparency International has documented several cases where public a access to beneficial ownership registries enabled journalists and activists to uncover corruption and money laundering. One of these cases is the &lt;a href=&#34;.https://www.occrp.org/en/openlux/&#34; &gt;OCCRP&amp;rsquo;s Open Lux Investigation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Open Lux investigation, journalists analysed beneficial owners registered in Luxembourg and found dozens of foreign citizens linked to corruption, embezzlement, and organised crime and, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://knowledgehub.transparency.org/assets/uploads/helpdesk/The-uses-and-impact-of-beneficial-ownership-information_2023.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Transparency International&lt;/a&gt; points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;What sets the Open Lux Investigation apart from the Panama Papers is that, &lt;strong&gt;for the first time, journalists did not have to rely on leaks and, instead, relied on publically available data&lt;/strong&gt; to uncover hidden owners using Luxembourg companies to own assets and open bank accounts.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation shows that actors other than law enforcement agencies are crucial to combating corruption and their role was recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Union in &lt;a href=&#34;https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;amp;docid=268059&amp;amp;pageIndex=0&amp;amp;doclang=EN&amp;amp;mode=lst&amp;amp;dir=&amp;amp;occ=first&amp;amp;part=1&amp;amp;cid=2425197&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;their judgment&lt;/a&gt; to close public access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Witness&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;global-witness&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#global-witness&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to identifying crime, actors are able to improve ownership data when that data is publically available. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/anonymous-company-owners/companies-we-keep/#chapter-0/section-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Global Witness&lt;/a&gt;, working with a group of volunteer data scientists at DataKind UK, analysed the UK&amp;rsquo;s beneficial ownership registries and successfully identified loopholes, information gaps and suspicous activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that most companies registering their benenficial owners at the Persons of Significant Control registry in the UK, is straightforward, with an average of 1.13 beneficial owners for each UK company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of these companies file highly suspicious entries that would never have been found were it not for the open data nature of the register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Watch found common methods for avoiding disclosure of a company&amp;rsquo;s real owners such as disclosing an ineligible foreign company as the beneficial owner, filing a statement that the company has no beneficial owners, or creating circular ownership structures where a company control themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the companies with a foreign owner, 10,000 declare a foreign company as their beneficial owner and of these 72% are in a secrecy jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their analysis resulted in a red flagging system to uncover high risk entries and recommendations to the UK government demonstrating the benefit of open ownership registries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is privacy an absolute right?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;is-privacy-an-absolute-right&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#is-privacy-an-absolute-right&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public ownership data helps civl society, investigative journalists and law enforcement scrutinise data and combine it with other datasets, increasing the likelihood of spitting criminal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having established that open ownership data, in practice, helps us prevent crime, let&amp;rsquo;s scrutinise the right to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety about data protection is understandable, especially in consideration of companies like Facebook and Cambridge Analytica known for their exploitation of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand why my friend sides with the CEUJ - the right to privacy is essential to our autonomy and it is important to respect privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, publishing information about who owns companies is different. As OpenOwnership&amp;rsquo;s Head of Policy, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openownership.org/en/blog/who-owns-our-companies-why-privacy-isnt-always-in-the-public-interest/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Zosia Sztykowski&lt;/a&gt; explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Publishing information about who owns companies is fundamentally different. This is about chaning the role that companies play in society. We often forget that the legal form that we call a company can&amp;rsquo;t exist without the state, and agreements between states. Therefore, they have the right, and even the responsibibility to ensure that they serve a social good. Open ownership data can do just that. All while also providing desirable incentives for legitimate businesses, including reducing the risk of being exposed to bad actors and supporting the stability of economies globally.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy is a critical right, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t absolute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a substantial ownership stake in a company gives that individual access to a range of benefits, including protection from personal liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange, is it not fair to expect business owners to help society ensure that companies are used for thier intended purposes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening a company is easy and benefits society as a whole. The unintended consequence is that this has made corporations easy tools for criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a balance here to be struck between personal freedoms and the responsibility to create a fairer society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, privacy invokes a claim to protection but never answers who we are trying to protect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense implies that &amp;ldquo;evidence that public ownership data prevents crime is weak&amp;rdquo;. There is likewise no evidence that closed ownership data protects more people with legitimate intentions than people with illegitimate intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
