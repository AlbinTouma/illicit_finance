He explained that he owns the company through his Scandinavian business.\nTracing his ownership structure would be time consuming and the task is becoming harder. Many of the only 23 ownership registries are closing down after the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) annulled public access to protect the individual’s right to privacy.\nOnly 23 public ownership registries exist and many have closed access to the public after the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) annulled public access to protect the individual’s right to privacy.\nImplied in the CJEU’s decision that public access is contrary to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is the belief evidence is too weak to show that public registries prevent crime.\nThe case for public ownership data sounds a lot like “if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear”, my friend said, agreeing with the CJEU.\nSo what is the evidence?\nAnti-corruption I think the strongest case for public ownership data is in the practice of fighting illict finance.","is-privacy-an-absolute-right#Is privacy an absolute right?":"Public ownership data helps civl society, investigative journalists and law enforcement scrutinise data and combine it with other datasets, increasing the likelihood of spitting criminal activity.\nHaving established that open ownership data, in practice, helps us prevent crime, let’s scrutinise the right to privacy.\nAnxiety about data protection is understandable, especially in consideration of companies like Facebook and Cambridge Analytica known for their exploitation of personal data.\nI understand why my friend sides with the CEUJ - the right to privacy is essential to our autonomy and it is important to respect privacy.\nHowever, publishing information about who owns companies is different. As OpenOwnership’s Head of Policy, Zosia Sztykowski explains:\n“Publishing information about who owns companies is fundamentally different. This is about chaning the role that companies play in society. We often forget that the legal form that we call a company can’t exist without the state, and agreements between states. Therefore, they have the right, and even the responsibibility to ensure that they serve a social good. Open ownership data can do just that. All while also providing desirable incentives for legitimate businesses, including reducing the risk of being exposed to bad actors and supporting the stability of economies globally.”\nPrivacy is a critical right, but it isn’t absolute.\nHaving a substantial ownership stake in a company gives that individual access to a range of benefits, including protection from personal liability.\nIn exchange, is it not fair to expect business owners to help society ensure that companies are used for thier intended purposes?\nOpening a company is easy and benefits society as a whole. The unintended consequence is that this has made corporations easy tools for criminals.\nThere is a balance here to be struck between personal freedoms and the responsibility to create a fairer society.\nIn addition, privacy invokes a claim to protection but never answers who we are trying to protect?\nThe defense implies that “evidence that public ownership data prevents crime is weak”. There is likewise no evidence that closed ownership data protects more people with legitimate intentions than people with illegitimate intentions.","the-impact-of-the-decision#The Impact of the Decision":"","the-reality-of-ownership-data#The reality of ownership data":""},"title":"Are ownership registries evidence-based?"},"/posts/where_find_ownership/":{"data":{"":"","how-is-social-media-used-in-osint-investigations#How is social media used in OSINT investigations?":"","neo4j---what-is-is-and-why-its-powerful#Neo4j - what is is and why it\u0026rsquo;s powerful":"How is social media used in OSINT investigations?
